Have you heard about the `process` of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been damaged, degraded or destroyed? Whether it’s from inappropriate forest exploitation, mining or deforestation for agricultural expansion, this post will show you a practical case study of mining in Guinea and how a mining company, Rio Tinto is using ecological restoration to recover back the ecosystems.

The `International Year of Biodiversity` was held in `2010` to raise awareness of the importance of biodiversity worldwide. At the same year, I am studying in Paris to get a Master degree in Integrated Land Management and planning. By inviting student to choose their own thesis subject for a biodiversity preservation project, Nathalie Machon, Professor of Ecology at the Paris Museum of Natural History, learned a lot about her students' interests and passions.

### How to reconcile mining and Biodiversity preservation ?

I choose this question as my thesis subject for one reason: Guinea.

Born and raised in Guinea, I knew that the mining industry is estimated directly and indirectly to contribute to 36% of the country GDP, and is therefore considered to be an essential part of living and economic development. However, mining activities destroyed ecosystems, produce ‘mine wastes’: unwanted solid and liquid materials which are currently uneconomic and contain contaminants in concentrations that pose serious hazards to ecosystem and human health, elements (iron) involved in biogeochemical cycles and components (metals) that are potentially economic and could be recovered.

I also knew that understanding and predicting the impacts of mining and mine wastes requires
knowledge of the links between their distribution and climate, geological hazards, ecosystem productivity, land-use and urbanisation in Guinea.

Such knowledge will enable mining companies, governments and non-governmental organisations to manage, remediate and exploit mine wastes and sustain the globally vital mining industry.

To be successful in solving this question, I spent some days and months researching bibliographical notes about mining in Guinea and others places for the first. After the

ici il faut brievement dire comment tu as commencé avec Rio et qu'est ce que tu as fait par la suite. et mentionnée qu'est ce que fait rio en terme de reboisement

o spend two 43-minute periods in the library researching reformers before writing a pitch for their favorite ones.

### Contactint RIO

The successful candidate will be responsible for developing research using remote sensing applications and other data to determine the global impacts of historic and contemporary mining.

Please find attached herewith my internship report which is organized in four parts:
 Context and objectives of the study
 Approach and methodology used
 Results
 Discussion, Recommendations and Continuation of the Study
With the aim to answer to one of my two working hypotheses, about the
classification of local plant species in ecological functional groups, it seems
necessary to continue the study to help determine the stages of ecological
succession in which they occur. This should help in deciding how to use these plants
in ecological restoration and rehabilitation efforts in the degraded zones of the forêt
classée du Pic de Fon.
During this internship, I have learned that Rio Tinto adopts high environmental
standards, finances impact assessment, and conducts research and deveropment
on ecological restoration and rehabilitation. To strengthen the ecological restoration
and rehabilitation work currently underway in the Pic the Fon Forest and ecological
issues of the region (especialy fire), this study led to a number of specific
recommendations that could be implemented for the protection and sustainable
management of this forest as well as for ecological restoration and rehabilitation.
In closing, I would like to give warm thanks to everyone for all their help.
